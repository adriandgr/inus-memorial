With great shock and deep sadness we share with you that on September 24th Inus passed away unexpectedly. His death is a tremendous tragedy and loss to this world. We all loved Inus, and are heartbroken. Our love is with Adrian (his partner), Lizel (his beloved sister), and Elizabeth (his mother and friend).  His memorial will take place on October 5th for close friends and family. 

Inus was a true global citizen, and touched the lives of many all over the world. In the days since his passing his loved ones have been flooded with messages of condolence. Sharing stories of Inusâ€™s  tenacious spirit, razor wit, and tenderness to those he knew. Full of colour, confidence, and profound awareness Inus championed being oneself and sharing that self openly.
